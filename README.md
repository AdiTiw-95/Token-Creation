The assessment consists of the creation of a smart contract. In the contract we must have :
1. Public variables for Token Name, Token Abbrv, and Total Supply.
2. Mapping of addresses to balances using address => uint.
3. The mint function that increases the total supply and the balance of a specific address.
4. The burn function that decreases the total supply and the balance of a specific address.
5. Implementing conditionals in the burn function to ensure the balance of the account is greater than or equal to the amount being burned.

This is how the necessary requirements mentioned were met.
